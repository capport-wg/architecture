   <section title="Introduction">
     <t>
       Problems with captive portals have been described in
       <xref target="I-D.nottingham-capport-problem"/>.
     </t>
     <t>
       This document standardizes an architecture for implementing captive portals
       that provides tools for addressing most of those problems.
     </t>
     <t>
       The architecture also attempts to enable IoT devices, in particular
       devices without user interfaces, to navigate a captive portal.
     </t>
     <t>
       The architecture uses the following mechanisms:
       <list>
         <t>DHCP/DHCP6 providing end-user devices with a URI in the
            Captive-Portal Router Advertisement option <xref target="RFC7710"/>.
            This URI is an API that the end-user devices access for
            information about what is required to escape captivity.
         </t>
         <t>Notifying end-user devices of captivity with ICMP/ICMP6 "unreachable" messages.
            This notification can work with any internet protocol, not just
            clear-text HTTP. This notification does not carry the portal URI,
            rather triggers the DHCP-provisioned portal to be accessed.
            This notification carries a "reason" that allows the devices
            to receive customized work-flows at the portal.
         </t>
         <t>
            Receipt of the ICMP/ICMP6 messages inform an end-user device
            that it is captive. This permits the device to take immediate
            action to satisfy the portal (according to its configuration/policy).
            The architecture recommends the device to query the
            DHCP-provisioned CAPPORT URI with the specified "reason".
            This API returns a status and a menu for navigating the captive portal.
            Typically one of the menu items is a web page suitable for browsing.
         </t>
       </list>
     </t>
     <t>
       The architecture attempts to provide privacy, authentication, and safety mechanisms
       to the extent possible.
     </t>

     <section anchor="section_dhcp" title="DHCP">
       <t>
         A standard for providing a portal URI is described in <xref target="RFC7710"/>.
         The CAPPORT architecture expects this URI to access the API described
         in <xref target="section_api"/>.
       </t>
       <t>
         Although it is not clear from RFC7710  what protocol should be executed
         at the specified URI, it may have been assumed to be an HTML page,
         and hence there may be clients assuming a browser should open this URI.
         For backwards compatibility, it might be necessary for the server
         to check Agent-Id when serving the URI.
       </t>
     </section>
     <section anchor="section_icmp" title="ICMP/ICMP6">
       <t>
         A mechanism to trigger captive portal work-flows in the end-user device
         is proposed earlier in <xref target="I-D.wkumari-capport-icmp-unreach"/>.

         * High level document describes further APIs allowing clients to make decisions
         * Can provide options for interactive or non-interactive clients
         * May want to provide a default http captive portal for clients wihch expect it
         * Should be able to: 
          * Ask for quota information (remaining time/bytes/etc)
          * Ask whether allowed through captive portal

        * May be interactive or non-iteractive
        * May have different mechanisms for notifying the user of the captive portal

          handling in response to it.
        * Needs to cache the URI for the captive portal API from the DHCP lease.
        * May cache credentials to respond to captive portal notifications
        * Interactive clients typically ask their users how to proceed through interacting
          with the captive portal. Interactions may be as simple as accepting a terms of agreement,
          or as complicated as filling out some forms.
        * An example interactive client is a smart phone.
        * Non interactive clients will likely be provisioned with credentials in order to automatically gain access.
        * An example non interactive client is an IoT device such as a smart thermostat.
        * May need to distinguish between types of clients here.

     <section anchor="section_capport_enforcement" title="Captive Portal Enforcement">
      <t>
        The Captive Portal Enforcement component applies captive portal policy to traffic moving between the captive network and the rest of the internet.
      </t>
      <t>
        * Sends ICMP for disallowed clients
        * Allows traffic through for allowed clients

   <section anchor="section_workflow" title="Solution Workflow">
    <t> This section describes the general workflow of solutions adhering to the architecture. </t>
    <t> 
    Initial connection
    1) The client joins the captive network by acquiring a DHCP lease
    2) The client learns the URI for the Captive Portal API from the DHCP response (rfc7710)
    3) The client attemps a connection outside the captive network
    4) The captive portal enforcement device drops the connective requests, and replies with an icmp unreach indicating that it is
       behind a captive portal, and that access is denied (I-D.wkumari-capport-icmp-unreach)
        *** Is this drop okay? ***
    5) The client handles the icmp unreachable message by invoking its captive portal handling infrastructure
    6) The captive portal handling infrastructure communicates with the Captive Portal API to gain access to outside the captive network
    7) The Captive Portal API indicates to the captive portal enforcement device that the client is allowed through
    8) The client's next connection attempt succeeds.
    </t>
    <t>
    Connection about to expire
    1) The client sends a packet to the outside network.
    2) The captive portal device detects that the client's access is about to expire (low quota/time/etc)
    3) The captive portal sends an icmp unreach to the client indicating that it needs to refresh its access.
            *** Will this interrupt communication somehow? ***
    4) The client device handles this message by invoking its captive portal handling infrsatructure.
    5) The captive portal handling infrastructure communicates with the Captive Portal API to gain access to outside the captive network
    6) The Captive Portal API gives more quota to the client by indicating to the captive portal enforcement device the new, extended quota.
    7) The client continues unaffected.
    </t>
    <t>
    Connection expired.
    1) The client sends a packet to the outside network.
    2) The captive portal device detects that the client's access has expired.
    3) The remaining workflow is that same as for the initial connection.
    What happens to a long-running flow here? Does it continue afterwards, or does communication need to be reestablished?

         The solution described here assumes that when the client needs to

     <section title="Risk of Nuisance Captive Portal">
       <t>
         It is possible for any user on the internet to send ICMP packets in an attempt
         to cause the receiving equipment to go to the captive portal. This has been
         considered and addressed in the following ways:
         <list>
           <t>The ICMP packet does not carry the URL, making this method safer
              than 307-redirect methods currently in use.
           </t>
           <t>The ICMP packet carries a token that would not be available, even to an
              on-path attacker. Although possible to guess by brute force, the 
              impact is nuisance due to other precautions.
           </t>
           <t>Even when redirected, the client securely authenticates with API servers.
           </t>
         </list>
       </t>
     </section>
     <section title="User Options">
       <t>
         The ICMP messaging informs the end-user device it is being held captive.
         There is no requirement that the device do something about this.
         Devices may permit users to disable automatic reaction to captive-portal indications.
         Hence, support is provided for users who wish to manually navigate the captive portal.
