   <section title="Introduction">
     <t>
       In this document, "Captive Portal" is used to describe a network to
       which a device may be voluntarily attached, such that network access is
       limited until some requirements have been fulfilled.  Typically a user
       is required to use a web browser to fulfil requirements imposed by the
       network operator, such as reading advertisements, accepting an
       acceptable-use policy, or providing some form of credentials.
     </t>
     <t>
       Implementations generally require a web server, some method to
       allow/block traffic, and some method to alert the user.  Common methods
       of alerting the user involve modifying HTTP or DNS traffic.
     </t>
     <t>
       Problems with captive portal implementations have been described in
       <xref target="I-D.nottingham-capport-problem"/>. [If that document
       cannot be published, consider putting its best parts into an appendix of
       this document.]
     </t>
     <t>
       This document standardizes an architecture for implementing captive portals
       that provides tools for addressing most of those problems. We are guided
       by these principles:
       <list style="symbols">
         <t>Solutions SHOULD NOT require the forging of responses from DNS or
            HTTP servers, or any other protocol.  In particular, solutions
            SHOULD NOT require man-in-the-middle proxy of TLS traffic.</t>
         <t>Solutions MUST operate at the layer of Internet Protocol (IP) or
            above, not being specific to any particular access technology such
            as Cable, WiFi or 3GPP.</t>
         <t>Solutions SHOULD allow a device to be alerted that it is in a
            captive network when attempting to use any application on the
            network.  (Versus requiring a user to visit a clear-text HTTP
            site in order to receive a notification.)</t>
         <t>Solutions SHOULD allow a device to learn that it is in a captive
            network before any application attempts to use the network.</t>
         <t>The state of captivity SHOULD be explicitly available to devices
            (in contrast to modification of DNS or HTTP, which is only
            indirectly machine-detectable by the client--by comparing
            responses to well-known queries with expected responses).</t>
         <t>The architecture MUST provide a path of incremental migration,
            acknowledging a huge variety of portals and end-user device
            implementations and software versions.</t>
         <t>The architecture SHOULD improve security by providing mechanisms
            for trust, allowing alerts from trusted network operators to be
            distinguished from attacks from untrusted agents.</t>
       </list>
     </t>
     <t>
       A side-benefit of the architecture described in this document is that
       devices without user interfaces are able to identify parameters of
       captivity.  However, this document does not yet describe a mechanism
       for such devices to escape captivity.
     </t>
     <t>
       The architecture uses the following mechanisms:
       <list style="symbols">
         <t>Network provisioning protocols provide end-user devices with a
            URI for the API that end-user devices query for information about
            what is required to escape captivity. DHCP, DHCPv6, and
            Router-Advertisement options for this purpose are available in
            <xref target="RFC7710"/>. Other protocols (such as RADIUS),
            Provisioning Domains
            <xref target="I-D.ietf-intarea-provisioning-domains"/>, or
            static configuration may also be used.
            A device MAY query this API at any time to determine whether the
            network is holding the device in a captive state.
         </t>
         <t>End-user devices are notified of captivity with ICMP/ICMP6 messages
            in response to traffic.
            This notification can work with any Internet protocol, not just
            clear-text HTTP. This notification does not carry the portal URI;
            rather it provides a notification to the User Equipment that it
            is in a captive state.
         </t>
         <t>
            Receipt of the ICMP/ICMP6 messages informs an end-user device that
            it is captive.
            In response, the device SHOULD query the provisioned API to obtain
            information about the network state.
            The device MAY take immediate action to satisfy the portal
            (according to its configuration/policy).
         </t>
       </list>
     </t>
     <t>
       The architecture attempts to provide privacy, authentication, and safety mechanisms
       to the extent possible.

     <section anchor="section_client" title="User Equipment">
      <t>
       The User Equipment is the device that a user desires to be attached to
       a network with full access to all hosts on the network (e.g., to have
       Internet access). The User Equipment communication is typically
       restricted by the Captive Portal Enforcement, described in <xref target="section_capport_enforcement"/>,
       until site-specific requirements have been met.
      </t>
      <t>
        At this time we consider only devices with web browsers, with web
        applications being the means of satisfying Captive Portal Conditions.
      </t>
      <t>
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>An example interactive User Equipment is a smart phone.</t>
        <t>SHOULD support provisioning of the URI for the Captive Portal API (e.g., by DHCP)</t>
        <t>SHOULD distinguish Captive Portal API access per network interface, in the manner
           of Provisioning Domain Architecture <xref target="RFC7556"/>.</t>
        <t>SHOULD have a mechanism for notifying the user of the Captive Portal</t>
        <t>SHOULD have a web browser so that the user may navigate the Captive Portal
           user interface.</t>
        <t>SHOULD be able to receive and validate the Captive Portal ICMP message
           types, and to access the Captive Portal API in response.</t>
        <t>MAY restrict application access to networks not granting full
           network access. E.g., a device connected to a mobile network may
           be connecting to a WiFi network; the operating system MAY
           avoid updating the default route until network access restrictions
           have been lifted (excepting access to the Captive Portal server).
           This has been termed "make before break".</t>
      </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        None of the above requirements are mandatory because (a) we do not wish
        to say users or devices must seek access beyond the captive network,
        (b) the requirements may be fulfilled by manually visiting the captive
        portal web application, and (c) legacy devices must continue to be
        supported.
      </t>
     </section>

     <section anchor="section_provisioning" title="Provisioning Service">
       <t>
         Here we discuss candidate mechanisms for provisioning the User
         Equipment with the URI of the API to query captive portal state and
         navigate the portal.
       </t>
       <section anchor="section_dhcp" title="DHCP or Router Advertisements">
         <t>
           A standard for providing a portal URI using DHCP or Router
           Advertisements is described in <xref target="RFC7710"/>.  The
           CAPPORT architecture expects this URI to indicate the API described
           in <xref target="section_api"/>.
         </t>
         <t>
           Although it is not clear from RFC7710  what protocol should be
           executed at the specified URI, some readers might have assumed it to
           be an HTML page, and hence there might be User Equipment assuming a
           browser should open this URI.  For backwards compatibility, it is
           RECOMMENDED that the server check the "Accept" field when serving
           the URI, and serve HTML pages for "text/html" and serve the API for
           "application/json". [REVISIT: are these details appropriate?]
         </t>
       </section>
       <section anchor="section_pvd" title="Provisioning Domains">
         <t>
           Although still a work in progress,
           <xref target="I-D.ietf-intarea-provisioning-domains"/>
           proposes a mechanism for User Equipment to be provided with PvD
           Bootstrap Information containing the URI for a JSON file containing
           key-value pairs to be downloaded over HTTPS.
           This JSON file would fill the role of the Captive Portal API
           described in <xref target="section_api"/>.
         </t>
         <t>
           The PvD security model provides secure binding between the
           information provided by the trusted Router Advertisement and the
           HTTPS server.
         </t>
         <t>
           One key-value pair can be used to indicate the network
           has restricted access, requiring captive portal navigation by a user.
           E.g., key="captivePortal" and value=&lt;URI of portal&gt;.
           The key-value pair should provide a different result when
           access is not restricted. E.g., key="captivePortal" and value="".
         </t>
         <t>
           This JSON file is extensible, allowing new key-value pairs
           to indicate such things as network access expiry time,
           URI for API access by IOT devices, etc.
         </t>
         <t>
           The PvD server MUST support multiple (repeated) queries from each
           User Equipment, always returning the current captive portal
           information.  The User Equipment is expected to make this query upon
           receiving (and validating) an ICMP Captive Portal message
           (see <xref target="section_icmp"/>).
         </t>
       </section>
     </section>

     <section anchor="section_api" title="Captive Portal API Server">
       <t>
         The purpose of a Captive Portal API is to permit a query of Captive
         Portal state without interrupting the user.  This API thereby removes
         the need for a device to perform clear-text "canary" HTTP queries to
         check for response tampering.
       </t>
       <t>
         The URI of this API will have been provisioned to the User Equipment.
         (Refer to <xref target="section_provisioning"/>).
       </t>
       <t>
         This architecture expects the User Equipment to query the API when the
         User Equipment attaches to the network and multiple times thereafter.
         Therefore the API MUST support multiple repeated queries from the same
         User Equipment, returning current state of captivity for the
         equipment.
       </t>
       <t>
         At minimum the API MUST provide: (1) the state of captivity and (2) a URI
         for a browser to present the portal application to the user.
         The API SHOULD provide evidence to the caller that it supports
         the present architecture.
       </t>
       <t>
         When user equipment receives (and validates) ICMP Captive Portal
         alerts, the user equipment SHOULD query the API to check the state.
         The User Equipment SHOULD rate-limit these API queries in the event of
         ICMP flooding by an attacker. (See <xref target="Security"/>.)
       </t>
       <t>
         The API MUST be extensible to support future use-cases by allowing
         extensible information elements. Suggestions include quota information,
         expiry time, method of providing credentials, security token for
         validating ICMP messages.
       </t>
        <t>
         The API MUST use TLS for privacy and server authentication.
         The implementation of the API MUST ensure both privacy and integrity of
         any information provided by or required by it.
        </t>
       <t>
         This document does not specify the details of the API.

      <t>
        The Captive Portal Enforcement component restricts network access to
        User Equipment according to site-specific policy. Typically User Equipment
        is permitted access to a small number of services and
        is denied general network access until it has performed some action.

      <t>
        As an upgrade path, captive portals MAY continue to support methods
        that work today, such as modification of port-80 HTTP responses to
        redirect users to the portal.  Various user-equipment vendors probe
        canary URLs to identify the state captivity [reference Mariko
        Kobayashi's survey]. While doing so, ICMP messages SHOULD also be sent,
        to activate work-flows in supporting devices.
        [TODO: give some thought to precise recommendations for backwards compatibility.]

     </section>
     <section anchor="section_icmp" title="ICMP/ICMP6">
       <t>
         ICMP messages have been selected for indicating to a sender that
         packets could not be delivered for reason of a network policy (in
         particular, captive portal). ICMP is already used to indicate reasons
         that packets could not be delivered (network unreachable, port
         unreachable, packet too large, etc.).
       </t>
       <t>
         A mechanism to trigger captive portal work-flows in the User Equipment
         is proposed in <xref target="I-D.wkumari-capport-icmp-unreach"/>.
       </t>
       <t>
         The Captive Portal Enforcement function is REQUIRED to send such
         ICMP messages when disallowed User Equipment attempts to send
         to the network.
         These ICMP messages MUST be rate-limited to a configurable rate.
       </t>
       <t>
         The ICMP messages MUST NOT be sent to the Internet devices. The indications
         are only sent to the User Equipment.
       </t>
       <t>
         The User Equipment operating system is NOT REQUIRED to deliver the
         impact of the ICMP message to the application that triggered it.
         The User Equipment might be able to satisfy the Captive Portal
         requirements quickly enough that existing transport connections are
         not impacted.

           Multiple components in the architecture interact with both the User
           Equipment and each other. Since the User Equipment is the focus of
           these interactions, the components must be able to both identify the
           user equipment from their interactions with it, and be able to agree
           on the identify of the user equipment when interacting with each
           other.
       </t>
       <t>
           The methods by which the components interact restrict the type of
           information that may be used as an identifying charactertics. This

       <section anchor="id_identifiers" title="Identifiers">
           <t>
               An Identifier is a chatacteristic of the User Equipment used by
               the components of a Captive Portal to uniquely determine which
               specific User Equipment is interacting with them.
               An Identifier MAY be a field contained in packets
               sent by the User Equipment to the External Network. Or, an
               Identifier MAY be an ephemeral property not contained in packets
               destined for the External Network, but instead correlated with
               such information through knowledge available to the different
               components.

       <section anchor="id_recommended_props" title="Recommended Properties">
        <t>
           The set of possible identifiers is quite large. However, in order
           to be considered a good identifer, an identifier SHOULD meet the
           following criteria. Note that the optimal identifier will likely
           change depending on the positino of the components in the network
           as well as the information available to them.

           An identifier SHOULD:
           <list style="symbols">
               <t>Uniquely Identify the User Equipment</t>
               <t>Be Hard to Spoof</t>
               <t>Be Visible to the API</t>
               <t>Be Visible to the Enforcement Device</t>

        </t>
        <section anchor="id_recommended_unique" title="Uniquely Identify User Equipment">
            <t>
                In order to uniquely identify the User Equipment, at most one user equipment
                interacting with the other components of the Captive Portal MUST have a given
                value of the identifier.
            </t>
            <t>
                Over time, the user equipment identified by the value MAY change. Allowing the
                identified device to change over time ensures that the space of possible
                identifying vallues need not be overly large.
            </t>
            <t>
                Independent Captive Portals MAY use the same identifying value to identify
                different User Equipment. Allowing indendent captive portals to reuse
                identifying values allows the identifier to be a property of the local
                network, expanding the space of possible identifiers.

        <section anchor="id_recommended_hard" title="Hard to Spoof">
            <t>
                A good identifier does not lend itself to being easily spoofed. At no time
                should it be simple or straightforward for one User Equipment to
                pretend to be another User Equipment, regardless of whether both are active
                at the same time. This property is particularly important when the user
                equipment is extended externally to devices such as billing systems, or where
                the identity of the User Equipment could imply liability.

        <section anchor="id_recommended_visible_api" title="Visible to the API">
            <t>
                Since the API will need to perform operations which rely on the identify
                of the user equipment, such as query whether it is captive, the API
                needs to be able to relate requests to the User Equipment making the

                The Enforcement Device will decide on a per packet basis whether it
                should be permitted to communicate with the external network. Since
                this decision depends on which User Equipment sent the packet, the
                Enforcement Device requires that it be able to map the packet to its
                concept of the User Equipment.

               To evaluate whether an identifer is appropriate, one should consider
               every recommended property from the perspective of interactions among
               the components in the architecture. When comparing identifiers, choose
               the one which best satifies all of the recommended properties. The
               architecture does not provide an exact measure of how well an identifier
               satisfies a given property; care should be taken in performing the
               evaluation.
           </t>
       </section>
       <section anchor="id_examples" title="Examples of an Identifier">
           <t>
               This section provides some examples of identifiers, along with some
               evaluation of whether they are good identifiers. The list of identifiers
               is not exhaustive. Other identifiers may be used. An important point to note
               is that whether the identifiers are good depends heavily on the capabilities
               of the components and where in the network the components exist.
           </t>
           <section anchor="id_example_interface" title="Physical Interface">
            <t>
               The physical interface by which the User Equipment is attached to the
               network can be used to identify the User Equipment. This identifier has
               the property of being extremely difficult to spoof: the User Equipment is
               unaware of the property; one User Equipment cannot manipulate its
               interactions to appear as though it is another.
           </t>

            <t>
               Further, if only a single User Equipment is attatched to a given physical
               interface, then the identifier will be unique. If multiple User Equipment
               is attached to the network on the same physical interface, then this property
               is not appropriate.
           </t>

            <t>
               Another consideration related to uniqueness of the User Equipment is that
               if the attached User Equipment changes, both the API server and the
               Enforcement Device must invalidate their state related to the User Equipment.
           </t>

            <t>

               The Enforcement Device needs to be aware of the physical interface,
               which constrains the environment: it must either be part of the device providing
               physical access (e.g., implemented in firmware), or packets traversing the network
               must be extended to include information about the source physical interface (e.g.
               a tunnel).
           </t>

            <t>
               The API server faces a similar problem, implying that it should co-exist with the
               Enforcement Device, or that the enforcement device should extend requests to it
               with the identifying information.
            </t>
           </section>
           <section anchor="id_example_IP_address" title="IP Address">
            <t>
                A natural identifier to consider is the IP address of the User Equipment.
                At any given time, no device on the network can have the same IP address
                without causing the network to malfunction, so it is appropriate from the
                perspective of uniqueness.
            </t>

            <t>
                However, it may be possible to spoof the IP address, particularly for
                malicious reasons where proper functioning of the network is not necessary
                for the malicious actor. Consequently, any solution using the IP address
                should proactively try to prevent spoofing of the IP address. Similarily,
                if the mapping of IP address to User Equipment is changed, the components
                of the architecture must remove or update their mapping to prevent spoofing.
                Demonstrations of return routeability, such as that required for TCP
                connection establishment, might be sufficient defense against spoofing,
                though this might not be sufficient in networks that use broadcast media
                (such as some wireless networks).
            </t>

            <t>
                Since the IP address may traverse multiple segments of the network, more
                flexibility is afforded to the Enforcement Device and the API server: they
                simply must exist on a segment of the network where the IP address is still
                unique. However, consider that a NAT may be deployed between the User Equipment
                and the Enforcement Device. In such cases, it is possible for the components
                to still uniquely identify the device if they are aware of the port mapping.
            </t>

            <t>
                In some situtations, the User Equipment may have multiple IP addresses, while
                still satisfying all of the recommended properties. This raises some challenges
                to the components of the network. For example, if the user equipment tries
                to access the network with multiple IP addresses, should the enforcement device
                and API server treat each IP address as a unique User Equipment, or should it
                tie the multiple addresses together into one view of the subscriber?
                An implementation MAY do either. Attention should be paid to IPv6 and the fact
                that it is expected for a device to have multiple IPv6 addresses on a single
                link. In such cases, idenfication could be performed by subnet, such as the /64
                to which the IP belongs.

     <section title="Trusting the Network">
       <t>
         When joining a network, some trust is placed in the network operator.
         This is usually considered to be a decision by a user on the basis of
         the reputation of an organization. However, once a user makes such a
         decision, protocols can support authenticating a network is operated
         by who claims to be operating it.  The Provisioning Domain
         Architecture <xref target="RFC7556"/> provides some discussion on
         authenticating an operator.
       </t>
       <t>
         Given that a user chooses to visit a Captive Portal URI, the URI location
         SHOULD be securely provided to the user's device. E.g., the DHCPv6 AUTH
         option can sign this information.
       </t>
       <t>
         If a user decides to incorrectly trust an attacking network, they might
         be convinced to visit an attacking web page and unwittingly provide
         credentials to an attacker. Browsers can authenticate servers but
         cannot detect cleverly misspelled domains, for example.
       </t>
     </section>
     <section title="Authenticated APIs">
       <t>
         The solution described here assumes that when the User Equipment needs to
         trust the API server, server authentication will be performed using TLS
         mechanisms.
       </t>
     </section>
     <section title="Secure APIs">
       <t>
           The solution described here requires that the API be secured using TLS.
           This is required to allow the user equipment and API server to exchange
           secrets which can be used to validate future interactions. The API must
           ensure the integrity of this information, as well as its confidentiality.
       </t>
     </section>
     <section title="Risk of Nuisance Captive Portal">
       <t>
         It is possible for any user on the Internet to send ICMP packets in an attempt
         to cause the receiving equipment to go to the captive portal. This has been
         considered and addressed in the following ways:
         <list>
           <t>The ICMP packet does not carry the URL, making this method safer
              than HTTP 3xx-redirect methods currently in use.
              The User Equipment does not have to use clear-text HTTP to solicit
              the URL of the portal.
           </t>
           <t>Because the ICMP messages will carry embedded packets sent by the
              sender, the receiver of the ICMP message can validate that the
              transport header is plausibly one it sent (i.e., the
              transport-layer 5-tuple matches an open connection; there is no
              need to save every packet it sent).
              This validation requires an off-path attacker to guess the
              5-tuple in order to affect a flow.
              It is trivial for an on-path attacker to send a plausible ICMP
              packet.  (This is not a new ICMP attack.)
              The impact of getting a valid ICMP packet to the User Equipment
              is that it will visit the CAPPORT API to check the status.
              For this reason we recommend the User Equipment rate-limit these
              requests to the API.
           </t>
           <t>We considered that the ICMP packet could carry a short secret
              token that would be known to the User Equipment and Captive
              Portal Enforcement device but would not be available to an
              attacker, even to an on-path attacker.
              Although possible to guess by brute force, the impact would be at
              worst a nuisance visit to the API.  We suggest that a 32-bit
              token would be sufficient to deter nuisance attacks.

         The ICMP messaging informs the User Equipment that it is being held
         captive.  There is no requirement that the User Equipment do something
         about this.
         Devices MAY permit users to disable automatic reaction to
         captive-portal indications for privacy reasons.
         However, there is the trade-off that the user doesn't get notified
         when network access is restricted.
         Hence, end-user devices MAY allow users to manually control captive
         portal interactions, possibly on the granularity of Provisioning
         Domains.

   <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

   <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
    1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
    2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
       (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

    Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
    If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
    directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
    with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
    filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
