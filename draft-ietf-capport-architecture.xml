      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>
       In this document, "Captive Portal" is used to describe a network to
       which a device may be voluntarily attached, such that network access is
       limited until some requirements have been fulfilled.  Typically a user
       is required to use a web browser to fulfill requirements imposed by the
       network operator, such as reading advertisements, accepting an
       acceptable-use policy, or providing some form of credentials.
      </t>
      <t>
       Implementations generally require a web server, some method to
       allow/block traffic, and some method to alert the user.  Common methods
       of alerting the user involve modifying HTTP or DNS traffic.
      </t>
      <t>
       Problems with captive portal implementations have been described in
       <xref target="I-D.nottingham-capport-problem"/>. [If that document
       cannot be published, consider putting its best parts into an appendix of
       this document.]
      </t>
      <t>
       This document standardizes an architecture for implementing captive portals
       that provides tools for addressing most of those problems. We are guided
       by these principles:
      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>Solutions SHOULD NOT require the forging of responses from DNS or
            HTTP servers, or any other protocol.  In particular, solutions
            SHOULD NOT require man-in-the-middle proxy of TLS traffic.</li>
        <li>Solutions MUST operate at the layer of Internet Protocol (IP) or
            above, not being specific to any particular access technology such
            as Cable, WiFi or 3GPP.</li>
        <li>Solutions MAY allow a device to be alerted that it is in a
            captive network when attempting to use any application on the
            network.</li>
        <li>Solutions SHOULD allow a device to learn that it is in a captive
            network before any application attempts to use the network.</li>
        <li>The state of captivity SHOULD be explicitly available to devices
            (in contrast to modification of DNS or HTTP, which is only
            indirectly machine-detectable by the client when it compares
            responses to well-known queries with expected responses).</li>
        <li>The architecture MUST provide a path of incremental migration,
            acknowledging a huge variety of portals and end-user device
            implementations and software versions.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>
       A side-benefit of the architecture described in this document is that
       devices without user interfaces are able to identify parameters of
       captivity.  However, this document does not yet describe a mechanism
       for such devices to escape captivity.
      </t>
      <t>
       The architecture uses the following mechanisms:
      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>Network provisioning protocols provide end-user devices with a
            URI for the API that end-user devices query for information about
            what is required to escape captivity. DHCP, DHCPv6, and
            Router-Advertisement options for this purpose are available in
            <xref target="RFC7710bis"/>. Other protocols (such as RADIUS),
            Provisioning Domains
            <xref target="I-D.pfister-capport-pvd"/>, or
            static configuration may also be used.
            A device MAY query this API at any time to determine whether the
            network is holding the device in a captive state.
         </li>
        <li>End-user devices can be notified of captivity with Captive Portal Signals
            in response to traffic.  This notification should work with any Internet
            protocol, not just clear-text HTTP. This notification does not carry the
            portal URI; rather it provides a notification to the User Equipment that
            it is in a captive state. This document will specify requirements for
            a signaling protocol which could generate Captive Portal Signals.
         </li>
        <li>
            Receipt of a Captive Portal Signal informs an end-user device that
            it could be captive.
            In response, the device MAY query the provisioned API to obtain
            information about the network state.
            The device MAY take immediate action to satisfy the portal
            (according to its configuration/policy).
         </li>
      </ul>
      <t>
       The architecture attempts to provide confidentiality, authentication, and safety mechanisms
       to the extent possible.

        <name>User Equipment</name>
        <t>
       The User Equipment is the device that a user desires to be attached to
       a network with full access to all hosts on the network (e.g., to have
       Internet access). The User Equipment communication is typically
       restricted by the Captive Portal Enforcement, described in <xref target="section_capport_enforcement"/>,
       until site-specific requirements have been met.
        </t>
        <t>
        At this time we consider only devices with web browsers, with web
        applications being the means of satisfying Captive Portal Conditions.
        An example interactive User Equipment is a smart phone.
        </t>
        <t>
        The User Equipment:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li></li>
          <li>SHOULD support provisioning of the URI for the Captive Portal API (e.g., by DHCP)</li>
          <li>SHOULD distinguish Captive Portal API access per network interface, in the manner
           of Provisioning Domain Architecture <xref target="RFC7556"/>.</li>
          <li>SHOULD have a mechanism for notifying the user of the Captive Portal</li>
          <li>SHOULD have a web browser so that the user may navigate the Captive Portal
           user interface.</li>
          <li>MAY prevent applications from using networks that do not grant full
           network access. E.g., a device connected to a mobile network may
           be connecting to a captive WiFi network; the operating system MAY
           avoid updating the default route until network access restrictions
           have been lifted (excepting access to the Captive Portal server) in
           the new network. This has been termed "make before break".</li>
        </ul>
        <t>
        None of the above requirements are mandatory because (a) we do not wish
        to say users or devices must seek full access to the captive network,
        (b) the requirements may be fulfilled by manually visiting the captive
        portal web application, and (c) legacy devices must continue to be
        supported.

           A standard for providing a portal URI using DHCP or Router
           Advertisements is described in <xref target="RFC7710bis"/>.  The

           Although still a work in progress,
           <xref target="I-D.pfister-capport-pvd"/>
           proposes a mechanism for User Equipment to be provided with PvD
           Bootstrap Information containing the URI for the JSON-based API
           described in <xref target="section_api"/>.

        <name>Captive Portal API Server</name>
        <t>
         The purpose of a Captive Portal API is to permit a query of Captive
         Portal state without interrupting the user.  This API thereby removes
         the need for User Equipment to perform clear-text "canary" HTTP queries to
         check for response tampering.
        </t>
        <t>
         The URI of this API will have been provisioned to the User Equipment.
         (Refer to <xref target="section_provisioning"/>).
        </t>
        <t>
         This architecture expects the User Equipment to query the API when the
         User Equipment attaches to the network and multiple times thereafter.
         Therefore the API MUST support multiple repeated queries from the same
         User Equipment and return the state of captivity for the equipment.
        </t>
        <t>
         At minimum, the API MUST provide: (1) the state of captivity and (2) a URI
         for the Captive Portal Server.
         The API SHOULD provide evidence to the caller that it supports
         the present architecture.
        </t>
        <t>
         When user equipment receives Captive Portal Signals, the user equipment
         MAY query the API to check the state.
         The User Equipment SHOULD rate-limit these API queries in the event of
         the signal being flooded. (See <xref target="Security"/>.)
        </t>
        <t>
         The API MUST be extensible to support future use-cases by allowing
         extensible information elements.
        </t>
        <t>
         The API MUST use TLS to ensure server authentication.
         The implementation of the API MUST ensure both confidentiality and 
         integrity of any information provided by or required by it.
        </t>
        <t>
         This document does not specify the details of the API.

        The Captive Portal Enforcement component restrict the network access of
        User Equipment according to site-specific policy. Typically User Equipment
        is permitted access to a small number of services and is denied general
        network access until it satisfies the Captive Portal Conditions.

        <t>
        User Equipment may send traffic to hosts blocked by the captive network prior to the Enforcement
        device granting it access. The Enforcement Device rightly blocks or resets these
        requests. However, in the absence of a signal from the Enforcement Device or interaction with
        the API server, the User Equipment can only guess at whether it is captive. Consequently,
        allowing the Enforcement Device to explicitly signal to the User Equipment that the
        traffic is being blocked may improve the user's experience.
        </t>
        <t>
        An Enforcement Device may also want to notify the User Equipment of a pending expiry
        of its access to the external network, so providing the Enforcement Device the ability
        to preemptively signal may be desirable.
        </t>
        <t>
        A specific Captive Portal Signaling Protocol is out of scope for this document.
        However, in order to ensure that future protocols fit into the architecture,
        requirements for a Captive Portal Signaling Protocol follow:
        </t>
        <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
          <li>Such notifications SHOULD NOT be easy to spoof.
               If an attacker can send spoofed notifications to the User Equipment,
               they can cause the User Equipment to unnecessarily access the API. Rather than
               relying solely on rate limits to prevent problems, a good protocol will strive
               to limit the feasibility of such attacks.
            </li>
          <li>It SHOULD be possible to send a notification before the captive portal closes.
               This will help ensure seamless connectivity for the user, as the User Equipment
               will not need to wait for a network failure to refresh its login. On receipt of
               preemptive notification, the User Equipment can prompt the user to refresh the 
               connection or satisfy the Captive Portal Conditions again.
             </li>
          <li>The signal SHOULD NOT include any information other than an indication that traffic
                is restricted, which can prompt the User Equipment to contact the API.</li>
        </ol>
        <t>

       The Captive Portal Signaling Protocol does not provide any means of indicating that the
       network prevents access to some destinations. The intent is to rely on the Captive Portal API
       and the web portal to which it points to communicate local network policies.
        </t>
        <t>The Captive Portal Enforcement function MAY send Captive Portal Signals when User Equipment
        that has not satisfied the Captive Portal Conditions attempts to send traffic to the network.
        These signals MUST be rate-limited to a configurable rate.
        </t>
        <t>
         The signals MUST NOT be sent to the destinations/peers that the User Equipment is
         restricted from accessing.
         The indications are only to be sent to the User Equipment.

      <t>
             Multiple components in the architecture interact with both the User
             Equipment and each other. Since the User Equipment is the focus of
             these interactions, the components must be able to both identify the
             user equipment from their interactions with it, and be able to agree
             on the identity of the user equipment when interacting with each
             other.
      </t>
      <t>
             The methods by which the components interact restrict the type of
             information that may be used as an identifying characteristics. This
             section discusses the identifying characteristics.

        <t>
                 An Identifier is a characteristic of the User Equipment used by
                 the components of a Captive Portal to uniquely determine which
                 specific User Equipment is interacting with them.
                 An Identifier MAY be a field contained in packets
                 sent by the User Equipment to the External Network. Or, an
                 Identifier MAY be an ephemeral property not contained in packets
                 destined for the External Network, but instead correlated with
                 such information through knowledge available to the different
                 components.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="id_recommended_props">
        <name>Recommended Properties</name>
        <t>
             The set of possible identifiers is quite large. However, in order
             to be considered a good identifier, an identifier SHOULD meet the
             following criteria. Note that the optimal identifier will likely
             change depending on the position of the components in the network
             as well as the information available to them.

             An identifier SHOULD:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>Uniquely Identify the User Equipment</li>
          <li>Be Hard to Spoof</li>
          <li>Be Visible to the API Server</li>
          <li>Be Visible to the Enforcement Device</li>
        </ul>
        <t>

             An identifier might only apply to the current point of network attachment. If the
             device moves to a different network location its identity could change.
        </t>
        <section anchor="id_recommended_unique">
          <name>Uniquely Identify User Equipment</name>
          <t>
                  In order to uniquely identify the User Equipment, at most one user equipment
                  interacting with the other components of the Captive Portal MUST have a given
                  value of the identifier.
          </t>
          <t>
                  Over time, the user equipment identified by the value MAY change. Allowing the
                  identified device to change over time ensures that the space of possible
                  identifying values need not be overly large.
          </t>
          <t>
                  Independent Captive Portals MAY use the same identifying value to identify
                  different User Equipment. Allowing independent captive portals to reuse
                  identifying values allows the identifier to be a property of the local
                  network, expanding the space of possible identifiers.

                  A good identifier does not lend itself to being easily spoofed. At no time
                  should it be simple or straightforward for one User Equipment to
                  pretend to be another User Equipment, regardless of whether both are active
                  at the same time. This property is particularly important when the user
                  equipment is extended externally to devices such as billing systems, or where
                  the identity of the User Equipment could imply liability.

          <name>Visible to the API Server</name>
          <t>
                  Since the API Server will need to perform operations which rely on the identity
                  of the user equipment, such as query whether it is captive, the API Server
                  needs to be able to relate requests to the User Equipment making the

                  The Enforcement Device will decide on a per packet basis whether it
                  should be permitted to communicate with the external network. Since
                  this decision depends on which User Equipment sent the packet, the
                  Enforcement Device requires that it be able to map the packet to its

                 To evaluate whether an identifier is appropriate, one should consider
                 every recommended property from the perspective of interactions among
                 the components in the architecture. When comparing identifiers, choose
                 the one which best satisfies all of the recommended properties. The
                 architecture does not provide an exact measure of how well an identifier
                 satisfies a given property; care should be taken in performing the
                 evaluation.

        <name>Examples of an Identifier</name>
        <t>
                 This section provides some examples of identifiers, along with some
                 evaluation of whether they are good identifiers. The list of identifiers
                 is not exhaustive. Other identifiers may be used. An important point to note
                 is that whether the identifiers are good depends heavily on the capabilities
                 of the components and where in the network the components exist.
        </t>
        <section anchor="id_example_interface">
          <name>Physical Interface</name>
          <t>
                 The physical interface by which the User Equipment is attached to the
                 network can be used to identify the User Equipment. This identifier has
                 the property of being extremely difficult to spoof: the User Equipment is
                 unaware of the property; one User Equipment cannot manipulate its
                 interactions to appear as though it is another.
          </t>
          <t>
                 Further, if only a single User Equipment is attached to a given physical
                 interface, then the identifier will be unique. If multiple User Equipment
                 is attached to the network on the same physical interface, then this property
                 is not appropriate.
          </t>
          <t>
                 Another consideration related to uniqueness of the User Equipment is that
                 if the attached User Equipment changes, both the API Server and the
                 Enforcement Device MUST invalidate their state related to the User Equipment.
          </t>
          <t>
                 The Enforcement Device needs to be aware of the physical interface,
                 which constrains the environment: it must either be part of the device providing
                 physical access (e.g., implemented in firmware), or packets traversing the network
                 must be extended to include information about the source physical interface (e.g.
                 a tunnel).
          </t>
          <t>
                 The API Server faces a similar problem, implying that it should co-exist with the
                 Enforcement Device, or that the enforcement device should extend requests to it
                 with the identifying information.
          </t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="id_example_IP_address">
          <name>IP Address</name>
          <t>
                  A natural identifier to consider is the IP address of the User Equipment.
                  At any given time, no device on the network can have the same IP address
                  without causing the network to malfunction, so it is appropriate from the
                  perspective of uniqueness.
          </t>
          <t>
                  However, it may be possible to spoof the IP address, particularly for
                  malicious reasons where proper functioning of the network is not necessary
                  for the malicious actor. Consequently, any solution using the IP address
                  SHOULD proactively try to prevent spoofing of the IP address. Similarly,
                  if the mapping of IP address to User Equipment is changed, the components
                  of the architecture MUST remove or update their mapping to prevent spoofing.
                  Demonstrations of return routeability, such as that required for TCP
                  connection establishment, might be sufficient defense against spoofing,
                  though this might not be sufficient in networks that use broadcast media
                  (such as some wireless networks).
          </t>
          <t>
                  Since the IP address may traverse multiple segments of the network, more
                  flexibility is afforded to the Enforcement Device and the API Server: they
                  simply must exist on a segment of the network where the IP address is still
                  unique. However, consider that a NAT may be deployed between the User Equipment
                  and the Enforcement Device. In such cases, it is possible for the components
                  to still uniquely identify the device if they are aware of the port mapping.
          </t>
          <t>
                In some situations, the User Equipment may have multiple IP addresses, while
                still satisfying all of the recommended properties. This raises some challenges
                to the components of the network. For example, if the user equipment tries
                to access the network with multiple IP addresses, should the enforcement device
                and API Server treat each IP address as a unique User Equipment, or should it
                tie the multiple addresses together into one view of the subscriber?
                An implementation MAY do either. Attention should be paid to IPv6 and the fact
                that it is expected for a device to have multiple IPv6 addresses on a single
                link. In such cases, identification could be performed by subnet, such as the /64
                to which the IP belongs.

	     The URLs provided in the API SHOULD contain all the information

        <name>Trusting the Network</name>
        <t>
         When joining a network, some trust is placed in the network operator.
         This is usually considered to be a decision by a user on the basis of
         the reputation of an organization. However, once a user makes such a
         decision, protocols can support authenticating that a network is operated
         by who claims to be operating it.  The Provisioning Domain
         Architecture <xref target="RFC7556"/> provides some discussion on
         authenticating an operator.
        </t>
        <t>
         Given that a user chooses to visit a Captive Portal URI, the URI location
         SHOULD be securely provided to the user's device. E.g., the DHCPv6 AUTH
         option can sign this information.
        </t>
        <t>
         If a user decides to incorrectly trust an attacking network, they might
         be convinced to visit an attacking web page and unwittingly provide
         credentials to an attacker. Browsers can authenticate servers but
         cannot detect cleverly misspelled domains, for example.

         The solution described here assumes that when the User Equipment needs to
         trust the API server, server authentication will be performed using TLS
         mechanisms.

      </section>
      <section>
        <name>Secure APIs</name>
        <t>
           The solution described here requires that the API be secured using TLS.
           This is required to allow the user equipment and API Server to exchange
           secrets which can be used to validate future interactions. The API MUST
           ensure the integrity of this information, as well as its confidentiality.

        <name>Risks Associated with the Signaling Protocol</name>
        <t>
         If a Signaling Protocol is implemented, it may be possible for any user on
         the Internet to send signals in attempt to cause the receiving equipment to
         communicate with the Captive Portal API. This has been considered, and implementations may
         address it in the following ways:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>The signal only informs the User Equipment to query the API. It does not
              carry any information which may mislead or misdirect the User Equipment.</li>
          <li>Even when responding to the signal, the User Equipment securely authenticates
               with API Servers.</li>
          <li>Accesses to the API Server are rate limited, limiting the impact of a repeated
              attack.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <name>User Options</name>
        <t>
         The Signal could inform the User Equipment that it is being held
         captive.  There is no requirement that the User Equipment do something
         about this.
         Devices MAY permit users to disable automatic reaction to
         captive-portal indications for privacy reasons.
         However, there would be the trade-off that the user doesn't get notified
         when network access is restricted.
         Hence, end-user devices MAY allow users to manually control captive
         portal interactions, possibly on the granularity of Provisioning
         Domains.

<abstract><t>In many environments offering short-term or temporary Internet access (such as coffee shops), it is common to start new connections in a captive portal mode.  This highly restricts what the customer can do until the customer has authenticated.  This document describes a DHCP option (and a Router Advertisement (RA) extension) to inform clients that they are behind some sort of captive-portal device, and that they will need to authenticate to get Internet access.  It is not a full solution to address all of the issues that clients may have with captive portals; it is designed to be used in larger solutions.  The method of authenticating to, and interacting with the captive portal is out of scope of this document.

              <t>This document is a product of the work of the Multiple Interfaces Architecture Design team.  It outlines a solution framework for some of the issues experienced by nodes that can be attached to multiple networks simultaneously.  The framework defines the concept of a Provisioning Domain (PvD), which is a consistent set of network configuration information.  PvD-aware nodes learn PvD-specific information from the networks they are attached to and/or other sources.  PvDs are used to enable separation and configuration consistency in the presence of multiple concurrent connections.</t>

      <name>Existing Captive Portal Detection Implementations</name>
      <t>
       Operating systems and user applications may perform various tests when
       network connectivity is established to determine if the device is
       attached to a network with a captive portal present. A common method is
       to attempt to make a HTTP request to a known, vendor hosted endpoint with
       a fixed response. Any other response is interpreted as a signal that a
       captive portal is present. This check is typically not secured with TLS,
       as a network with a captive portal may intercept the connection, leading
       to a host name mismatch. This has been referred to as a "canary" request
       because, like the canary in the coal mine, it can be the first sign
       that something is wrong.
      </t>

      <t>
       Another test that can be performed is a DNS lookup to a known address
       with an expected answer. Such tests may be less reliable as the captive
       portal may only be intercepting TCP traffic and deliberately excluding
       the interception of DNS queries. DNS queries not using UDP may
       potentially fail this test if operating over TCP or DNS over HTTP.
      </t>

      <t>
       Malicious or misconfigured networks with a captive portal present may
       not intercept these requests and choose to pass them through or decide to
       impersonate, leading to the device having a false negative.
